## Description

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for an intro section with dropdown navigation. The page features a navigation bar with dropdown menus for "Features" and "Company", a "Careers" and "About" link, as well as login and register options. On smaller screens, a hamburger menu button appears, which toggles the navigation bar visibility. The JavaScript functionality enhances user interaction by adding event listeners for the hamburger menu button and the dropdown menus. When the hamburger menu button is clicked, it toggles the navigation bar's visibility and an overlay that shades the rest of the screen. The "Features" and "Company" dropdown menus show or hide their respective options when clicked, changing the dropdown arrow's direction accordingly. The overlay ensures focus remains on the navigation menu when it is open on smaller screens.


## Features

### Responsive Navigation Menu:

- Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens, users can toggle the navigation menu by clicking the hamburger icon.
- Dropdown Menus: Users can expand and collapse the "Features" and "Company" dropdown menus to view more options.

### Interactive Elements:

- Dropdown Menu Items: Each item within the dropdown menus is clickable and includes icons for better visual context.
- Overlay Effect: An overlay appears to shade the rest of the screen when the side navigation bar is open, ensuring the userâ€™s focus is on the menu.

### Responsive Layout:

- The layout adjusts gracefully between desktop and mobile views, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

### Call to Action:

- Learn More Button: A prominent button encourages users to learn more about the service.

### Brand Logos:

- Displays brand logos, providing visual credibility and partnership information.


## Technologies Used

### JavaScript:
